## For Developers

### Installation

#### API

Our API is built with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/), a web framework for Rust. So, you'll need to get Rust and Cargo on
your machine to get started. üõ†Ô∏è

The easiest way to install Rust and Cargo is by using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). It's
the [recommended tool](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for managing Rust versions and associated tools for your
project.

Then:

```bash
cd api
cd hardhat_env
yarn
cd ..
VITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 SERVICE_VERSION="v0.1.1" cargo run
```

#### Plugin

The plugin it self is a React project, you'll need to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm).

```bash
cd plugin;
pnpm install;
```

#### Running the development environment

Firstly, you need to define ENV variables for the server:

- VITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 - the address of the UI
- SERVICE_VERSION="v0.0.1" - the version of the back-end (should be less than version of UI)

And ENV variables for the plugin:

- API_SERVICE_URL="http://0.0.0.0:8000" - the address of the API
- WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=<your_walletconnect_project_id> - the project id for WalletConnect
- STARKNET_DEVNET_URL="https://starknet-remix-devnet.nethermind.io" - the address of the StarkNet devnet

You need to be running both the server and the plugin in order to have a working environment.

For your dev environment:

```bash
cd plugin;
pnpm run start;
```

For an optimized build (will not listen to changes):

```
pnpm run deploy;
pnpm run serve;
```

```bash
cd api
cd hardhat_env
yarn
cd ..
VITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 SERVICE_VERSION="v0.1.1" cargo run
```

or alternatively, you can run the server in watch mode (with `cargo watch`):

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch;
cargo watch -x run;
```

##### Connecting the plugin

In [Remix](http://remix-alpha.ethereum.org/), go to the `Plugin Manager` at the bottom of the left panel, and click
on `Connect to a Local Plugin`.

Then, chose a name for the plugin, and in the `URL` field, enter `http://localhost:3000`, the `Type of Connection`
should `iframe` and the `Location in remix` `Side Panel` and click on `Ok`.

You should be all set to see the magic happen! Activate the plugin and it should now be visible and ready to be hacked
with! üöÄ
